# SCSS-Auto-Compiler
A simple batch script that will auto compile your SCSS.

To use this compiler, first create a style.scss file. This file will contain all your SCSS code. 
Run the Compiler.bat and press Y/N in case you want to compress the SCSS or not.

If you don't want to input everytime your choice, you can use BruteCompiler.bat that will compile an uncompressed version of your SCSS code and exit.

You can edit it for other file names if you want.
